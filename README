This is my first eclipse plugin, and I'm pretty sure not everything is perfect. There
are probably files in here that don't need to be, but I didn't want to miss anything. With
that said here is what this is supposed to be:

CFWarning

My goal with this plugin is to make a simple eclipse view that will report errors in CFML code. Right
now the plugin handles the following two items:

	1. It scans tag components for unscoped variables and displays warnings
	2. It scans tag components for cfdump and cfabort tags and displays warnings
	3. Double click on warning items takes you to the line in the file
	
Some of the features I would really like add are:

	1. Script component support for all the features that the tag component has
	2. Suggested resolutions
	3. Query parameter checking
	4. Unused local variables checking
	
There are probably more that I will think of, but that sounds good right now. One other item to note, is that
this plugin is designed right now for CF9. I have made assumptions about the use of the local scope. It also
assumes that the 'beans' scope is valid.

How to setup the project in Eclipse PDE
1. Checkout CFWarning from GitHub
2. Setup included libraries to include the JRE System and Plug-in Dependency libraries if they are not
3. In order to run the tests you will need to put the yamlbeans jar in the root of the project and setup this depenendency.

I think this is it right now.
